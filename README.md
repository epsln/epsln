# Hi, I'm epsilon ($\varepsilon$).

I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer, trying to apply the latest and best Deep Learning techniques to monitor and enhance massive amounts of social data. 
I am specialized in Computer Vision, having significant experience applying [Object Detection in Archaeological Geophysical Surveys](https://github.com/epsln/LiDARAutoDetection), but I don't shy away from NLP or any other task for that matter.

I am (very) passionate about Mathematics, especially Dynamical and Iterated Systems. I try to use Mathematics to create art that is not human. I have made a [very fast and fairly complete implementation of Indra's Pearl in C](https://github.com/epsln/ceendrasPearl), which is threaded and can generate some really great images. I have also a few of my Processing sketch in open source, just because. I have also a small project that tries to generate coherent playlist based on the embedding of your songs. 

I have a [blog](epsln.github.io), which I try to update regularly. I talk mostly about mathematics, although some Deep Learning stuff is in the pipeline.
