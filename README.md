# Hi, I'm epsilon.

I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer, trying to apply the latest and best Deep Learning techniques to monitor and enhance massive amounts of social data. 
I am specialized in Computer Vision, having significant experience applying [Object Detection in Archaeological Geophysical Surveys](https://github.com/epsln/LiDARAutoDetection), but I don't shy away from NLP or any other task for that matter.

I am (very) passionate about Mathematics, especially Dynamical and Iterated Systems. I try to use Mathematics to create art that is not human. I have made a [very fast and fairly complete implementation of Indra's Pearl in C](https://github.com/epsln/ceendrasPearl), which is threaded and can generate some really great images. In case you want a nice UI, I have also implemented it in OpenFrameworks. I have also a few of my Processing sketch in open source. I made ~mortier~, a simple but powerful tesselation generator in Python. It handles the "Polygon in Contact" techniques which allows it to creates and infinity of intricate tesselations. Mortier also supports Penrose Tiles and Hyperbolic Tesselation. 

I have a [blog](epsln.github.io), which I try to update regularly. I talk mostly about mathematics, although some Deep Learning stuff is in the pipeline.
